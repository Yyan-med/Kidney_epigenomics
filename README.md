# Kidney_epigenomics
Kidney disease affects more than 850 million people worldwide. The development of drug therapeutics has been limited by poor mechanistic understanding. Epigenetic changes may fill a critical gap in our understanding of kidney disease development. Here, we present the most comprehensive analysis to date to define the role and contribution of epigenetic changes to kidney disease development.

1.	We performed a genome-wide methylation profiling of the largest human kidney collection (n=399 samples) and coupled it with the most stringent statistical analysis. We present validated differential methylation positions associated with disease severity.
2.	We performed single-nuclear open chromatin analysis of over 60,000 human kidney cells and present cell type-specific open chromatin changes in kidney disease.
3.	We identified differentially methylated positions associated with disease states and discovered that nearly 30% of these alterations were influenced by underlying genetic variations.
4.	We identified disease-associated genes, cell types, and mechanisms.
5.	Furthermore, we implemented methylation risk scores (MRS), which demonstrated improved disease state annotation and prediction of kidney disease development.
6.	Collectively, our findings suggest a causal relationship between epigenetic changes and kidney disease pathogenesis, offering potential avenues for novel risk stratification development.
